    <h2>Core concepts</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>Group</dt>
      <dd>
        A ransomware group or data-extortion collective tracked by RansomLook. Groups usually operate one or more
        leak sites, file servers and communication channels.
      </dd>

      <dt>Actor</dt>
      <dd>
        A named individual or pseudonym (threat actor, developer, affiliate, broker, admin, etc.) related to
        ransomware or data-extortion activity.
      </dd>

      <dt>Victim / Post</dt>
      <dd>
        A single entry published by a group about a targeted organisation. In RansomLook this is usually stored as a
        “post” and is associated with one group and one discovery timestamp.
      </dd>

      <dt>RaaS (Ransomware-as-a-Service)</dt>
      <dd>
        Operating model where a core team develops the ransomware and infrastructure, while affiliates perform
        intrusions and share the profits.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Infrastructure types</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>DLS (Dedicated Leak Site / Darknet Leak Site)</dt>
      <dd>
        Tor-based website operated by a group to list victims and publish stolen data when ransoms are not paid.
        This is the main “blog” used for extortion pressure.
      </dd>

      <dt>FS (File Server / File Storage)</dt>
      <dd>
        Infrastructure used to host or distribute stolen data (archives, samples, full dumps). This can be a separate
        Tor service, a clearnet file host, or another storage endpoint distinct from the public DLS.
      </dd>

      <dt>Chat</dt>
      <dd>
        Communication endpoints used for negotiation or contact with victims and affiliates. This includes web-based
        chat on Tor portals, Telegram channels, X/Twitter accounts, email and other messaging systems.
      </dd>

      <dt>Admin / Affiliates panel</dt>
      <dd>
        Administrative or affiliate-focused infrastructure that is not intended for public victim browsing. Typical
        examples: recruitment panels for affiliates, management portals for campaigns, internal status or payment pages.
      </dd>

      <dt>Relay / Mirror</dt>
      <dd>
        A technical copy of a group’s site (DLS, FS, chat portal, admin panel) accessible at a different domain or
        onion address. RansomLook tracks each relay or mirror as a separate location, with its own online/offline status.
      </dd>

      <dt>Slug</dt>
      <dd>
        Normalised name used internally to build URLs for a specific location of a group (for example a particular
        DLS, FS or chat endpoint). Slugs are used to create deterministic filenames and links.
      </dd>

      <dt>Private location</dt>
      <dd>
        A location (DLS, FS, chat, admin) that is stored in the database but intentionally not displayed to
        unauthenticated visitors. It is still used for scraping, monitoring and metrics.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Data and metrics</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>Parser</dt>
      <dd>
        Piece of code dedicated to a specific group or site. The parser extracts structured data from HTML pages
        (victim name, sector, country, dates, etc.) and populates the internal database.
      </dd>

      <dt>Discovery date / Discovered</dt>
      <dd>
        Timestamp at which RansomLook first observed a victim post on a group’s infrastructure. It may differ from
        the original intrusion or encryption date.
      </dd>

      <dt>Leak / Dataleak</dt>
      <dd>
        Public dataset containing credentials or other information exposed in previous breaches. RansomLook integrates
        external leak databases for enrichment and pivoting.
      </dd>

      <dt>Ransomware notes / Ransom notes</dt>
      <dd>
        Text files or HTML pages left on compromised systems by ransomware operators. RansomLook indexes ransom notes
        from external sources to help identify families and operations.
      </dd>

      <dt>Crypto address / Wallet</dt>
      <dd>
        Cryptocurrency address controlled or used by a group or affiliate to receive ransom payments. These addresses
        are monitored and correlated with known ransomware activity.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Ecosystem and sources</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>Markets / Forums</dt>
      <dd>
        Darknet or clearnet platforms where actors trade access, data, tools or services. RansomLook tracks these as
        separate entities from ransomware groups, with their own relays and metrics.
      </dd>

      <dt>RF Dumps / Recorded Future</dt>
      <dd>
        Optional private integration providing additional leak information and dumps from Recorded Future. When
        enabled, it appears as an extra data source in RansomLook.
      </dd>

      <dt>Onion service (Tor)</dt>
      <dd>
        Hidden service accessible through the Tor network. Most DLS, FS and negotiation panels are onion services,
        sometimes with multiple relays or versions.
      </dd>

      <dt>v3 onion</dt>
      <dd>
        Current version of Tor hidden service addresses (56-character <code>.onion</code> domains). RansomLook tracks
        onion versions to better classify and monitor infrastructure changes.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Relationships</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>Affiliates</dt>
      <dd>
        External operators who work with a core ransomware group or service. Affiliates perform intrusions, deploy
        ransomware and share a percentage of the ransom with the core operators.
      </dd>

      <dt>Peers</dt>
      <dd>
        In the actor model, “peers” are other actors linked to a given individual or pseudonym. This can represent
        collaboration, shared infrastructure or repeated co-appearance in the same operations.
      </dd>

      <dt>Groups / Forums (relations)</dt>
      <dd>
        Links between one actor and multiple groups or markets. RansomLook stores these relations so users can explore
        which actors appear to operate across which ecosystems.
      </dd>
    </dl>
